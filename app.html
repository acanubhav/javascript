        <h1>Shush the Silent timer</h1>
        <img src="shush.png">description
When you turn your ringer off for a movie, this app turns it back on afterwards.

It's activated when you silence your ringer using the volume buttons. You don't need to remember a special app! Once your ringer is off, it asks you how long to stay silent. Never miss another important call.

Great for class, the office, movies and sleep.

Got Problems?
• If Shush doesn't pop up automatically, try launching it manually first.
• LG Optimus can't Shush on Gingerbread due to a bug in LG's software.
• MIUI: follow these instructions: http://goo.gl/yzcKG

  <h1>The Panic Button</h1>

        PanicButton makes it easier for you to hide all of your tabs at once just by clicking on a button. They are then saved as bookmarks in a separate folder. Afterwards, the PanicButton turns green and shows you how many tabs are currently hidden.

Another click on the PanicButton restores all of the tabs you have hidden earlier.

If you don't want to restore your tabs just delete the "temporary Panic" folder in Chrome's "Other bookmarks"-folder.

You can also use PanicButton's keyboard shortcut. Just press F4 to hide and restore all your tabs. (currently only works when you're on a http:// or https:// page)

PanicButton was originally developed by Thomas Greiner (http://twitter.com/ThomasGreiner) and is now part of the HideMyAss.com family of privacy applications

        Just install it by clicking on the install button above. It takes a single click. After that, just visit one of the sites, say Flipkart and view a product page.  

Let us say you are looking to buy a Nokia Lumia 520. If you are on that page on Flipkart, you will notice a little dark rupee  on a blue icon to the left side. That's the MakkhiChoose panel.

Here, the prices of Nokia Lumia 520 on all the other sites are listed. When the price is lower on one of these websites, the rupee will glow a happy green. Additionally, a message will show up next to the price of the product.  

This works on all products, not just smartphones, so go ahead and browse and see MakkhiChoose at work.


NOTE: This add-on has no affiliation with any of the above websites and is an independent offering.
